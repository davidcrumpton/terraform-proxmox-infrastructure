I will paste a Proxmox LXC config file. Please generate a **professional Terraform configuration** for it using the Telmate Proxmox provider. 

Requirements:

1. Generate a main resource file (e.g., `lxc.tf`) and a `variables.tf` file.  
2. Use **clean production formatting** (minimal comments, clear structure).  
3. Keep the container **unprivileged**.  
4. Preserve **tags** if present, as a list in Terraform.  
5. Use `ubuntu-22.04-standard_22.04-1_amd64.tar.zst` as the `ostemplate` for Ubuntu containers.  
6. Include **mount points** as per the `.conf` file.
7. Populate `variables.tf` with the following defaults include mount point if defined in the `.conf`:

   - vmid = 117
   - hostname = "plex"
   - cores = 4
   - memory = 928
   - swap = 512
   - rootfs_storage = "local-lvm"
   - rootfs_size = "8G"
   - bridge = "vmbr0"

8. Generate an optional `terraform.tfvars.example` with these defaults.  
9. Ensure the node is hardcoded as `pve02` in the resource.  
10. Include placeholders for network interface, but copy MAC addresses and settings if present in the `.conf`.  

Output format:  

- First message: the main Terraform file (`lxc.tf`)  
- Second message: `variables.tf`  
- Third message: `terraform.tfvars.example`  

Please wait for me to paste the LXC `.conf` file before generating anything.
